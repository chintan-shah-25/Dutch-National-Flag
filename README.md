Dutch-National-Flag
===================

Dutch National Flag(sorting array of three kinds)

The Dutch National Flag Algorithm sorts an array of red, blue, and white objects by separating them from each other based on their colors. Hence, we can adopt the algorithm to sort any array of three different kinds of objects / values. 
If you use any general sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort that the complexity would be O(nlogn) but this problem can be solved in linear time i.e O(n). You can look at the java file for implementation.
